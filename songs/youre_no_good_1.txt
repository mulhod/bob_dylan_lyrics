Well, I don't know why I love you like I do –
Nobody in the world can get along with you.
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den –
I come home last night, you wouldn't even let me in.

Well, sometimes you're as sweet as anybody wanna be
When you get a crazy notion of jumping all over me.
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
And you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.

I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama,
I helped you when you had no food to eat.
You're the kind of woman I just don't understand –
You're taking all my money and give it to another man.

Well, you're the kinda woman makes a man lose his brains,
You're the kinda woman drives a man insane.
You give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied,
You give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die,
Well, you give me the blues, I wanna lay down and die.
