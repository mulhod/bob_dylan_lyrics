<i>This song is called "Hurricane". If you got any political pull at all, maybe you can help us get this man outta jail, back onto the streets.</i>
</div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Pistol-shots ring out on a barroom night,
      </div>
<div>
       Enter Patty Valentine from the outer hall,
      </div>
<div>
       She sees a bartender in a pool of blood,
      </div>
<div>
       Cries out, "My God, they've killed 'em all!"
      </div>
<div>
       Here come the story of the "Hurricane",
      </div>
<div>
       The man the authorities came to blame
      </div>
<div>
       For something that he never done,
      </div>
<div>
       Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Three bodies lying there does Patty see
      </div>
<div>
       And another man named Bello, moving mysteriously.
      </div>
<div>
       "I didn't do it!" he says and he throws up his hands,
      </div>
<div>
       "I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand!
      </div>
<div>
       I saw them leaving," he says and he stops,
      </div>
<div>
       "One of us had better call up the cops."
      </div>
<div>
       And so Patty calls the cops
      </div>
<div>
       And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot New Jersey night.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Meanwhile far away in another part of town,
      </div>
<div>
       Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around,
      </div>
<div>
       Number one contender for the middleweight crown
      </div>
<div>
       Had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
      </div>
<div>
       When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road –
      </div>
<div>
       Just like the time before and the time before that.
      </div>
<div>
       In Paterson, that's the way things go:
      </div>
<div>
       If you're black, you might as well not show up on the street 'less you wanna draw the heat.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Alfred Bello laid this rap on the cops,
      </div>
<div>
       He and Arthur Dexter Bradley went a-prowling around.
      </div>
<div>
       Saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights,
      </div>
<div>
       Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates.
      </div>
<div>
       And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head,
      </div>
<div>
       Cop said, "Wait a minute, boys, this one's not dead!"
      </div>
<div>
       So they took him to the infirmary
      </div>
<div>
       And, though this man could hardly see, they told him he could identify the guilty men.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in,
      </div>
<div>
       Took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.
      </div>
<div>
       The wounded man looks up through his one, dying eye,
      </div>
<div>
       Said, "Why'd you bring him in here for! He ain't the guy!"
      </div>
<div>
       Let's hear the story of the "Hurricane",
      </div>
<div>
       The man the authorities came to blame
      </div>
<div>
       For something that he never done,
      </div>
<div>
       Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Four months later, the ghettoes are in flame,
      </div>
<div>
       Rubin's in South America, fighting for his name,
      </div>
<div>
       While Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
      </div>
<div>
       And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame.
      </div>
<div>
       "Remember that murder that happened in a bar?
      </div>
<div>
       Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
      </div>
<div>
       Think you'd like to play ball with the law?
      </div>
<div>
       Think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night? Don't forget, now, you are white."
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Arthur Dexter Bradley said, "I'm really not sure."
      </div>
<div>
       The cops said, "A poor boy like you could use a break –
      </div>
<div>
       We got you for that motel job. We were talking to your friend, Bello,
      </div>
<div>
       You don't wanna have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow.
      </div>
<div>
       You'll be doing society a favor,
      </div>
<div>
       That son-of-a-bitch is brave and getting braver.
      </div>
<div>
       We wanna put his ass in stir,
      </div>
<div>
       We wanna pin this triple murder on him – he ain't no 'Gentleman Jim'."
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Rubin could take a man out with just one punch,
      </div>
<div>
       But he never did like to talk about it all that much.
      </div>
<div>
       "It's my work," he'd say, "and I do it for the pay.
      </div>
<div>
       When it's over, I'd just as soon go on my way"––
      </div>
<div>
       Up into some paradise
      </div>
<div>
       Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
      </div>
<div>
       And ride a horse along the trail,
      </div>
<div>
       But then they took him to the jailhouse, where they try to turn a man into a mouse.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       All of Rubin's cards were marked in advance,
      </div>
<div>
       The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance:
      </div>
<div>
       The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums,
      </div>
<div>
       To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum,
      </div>
<div>
       And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger,
      </div>
<div>
       No one doubted that he pulled the trigger,
      </div>
<div>
       Though they could not produce the gun,
      </div>
<div>
       The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed and the all-white jury agreed.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Rubin Carter was a-falsely tried,
      </div>
<div>
       Crime was murder one and guess who testified?
      </div>
<div>
       --Arthur Dexter Bradley and Bello and they both lied
      </div>
<div>
       And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride.
      </div>
<div>
       How can the life of such a man
      </div>
<div>
       Be in the palm of some fool's hand?
      </div>
<div>
       To see him obviously framed
      </div>
<div>
       Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
      </div>
<div>
       Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
      </div>
<div>
       While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell,
      </div>
<div>
       An innocent man in a living hell.
      </div>
<div>
       That's the story of the "Hurricane",
      </div>
<div>
       But it won't be over till they clear his name
      </div>
<div>
       And give him back the time he's done,
      </div>
<div>
       Put in a prison cell, but one time he could've been the champion of the world.
