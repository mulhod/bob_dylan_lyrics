<p>
<div>
       The festival was over and the boys were all planning for a fall,
      </div>
<div>
       The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall,
      </div>
<div>
       The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down,
      </div>
<div>
       Anyone with any sense had already left town;
      </div>
<div>
       He was standing in the doorway, looking like the jack of hearts.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       He moved across the mirrored room, "Set it up for everyone," he said,
      </div>
<div>
       Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads,
      </div>
<div>
       And he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin,
      </div>
<div>
       "Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?"
      </div>
<div>
       Then he moved into the corner, face down like the jack of hearts.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs,
      </div>
<div>
       Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair.
      </div>
<div>
       Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide,
      </div>
<div>
       A gentle breeze was blowing – you could feel it from inside,
      </div>
<div>
       Lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Big Jim was no one's fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine,
      </div>
<div>
       He made his usual entrance, looking so dandy and so fine.
      </div>
<div>
       With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place,
      </div>
<div>
       He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste,
      </div>
<div>
       But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town,
      </div>
<div>
       She slipped in through the side door, looking like a queen without a crown.
      </div>
<div>
       She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear,
      </div>
<div>
       "Sorry, darling, that I'm late," but he didn't seem to hear:
      </div>
<div>
       He was staring into space over at the jack of hearts.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
<i>I know I've seen that face somewhere</i>, Big Jim was thinking to himself,
      </div>
<div>
<i>Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf</i>.
      </div>
<div>
       But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights a-did dim
      </div>
<div>
       And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him,
      </div>
<div>
       Staring at the butterfly, who just drew the jack of hearts.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child,
      </div>
<div>
       She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled.
      </div>
<div>
       She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
      </div>
<div>
       With men in every walk of life, which took her everywhere,
      </div>
<div>
       But she'd never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined,
      </div>
<div>
       The drilling in the wall kept up, but no one seemed to pay it any mind.
      </div>
<div>
       It was known all around that Lily had Jim's ring
      </div>
<div>
       And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king –
      </div>
<div>
       No, nothing ever would, except maybe the jack of hearts.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife,
      </div>
<div>
       She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim's wife.
      </div>
<div>
       She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide,
      </div>
<div>
       Was looking to do just one good deed before she died –
      </div>
<div>
       She was gazing to the future, riding on the jack of hearts.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Lily took her dress off, buried it away,
      </div>
<div>
       "Has your luck run out?" she laughed at him, "Well, I guess you musta known it would someday.
      </div>
<div>
       Be careful not to touch the wall – there's a brand-new coat of paint,
      </div>
<div>
       I'm glad to see you're still alive, you're looking like a saint."
      </div>
<div>
       Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair,
      </div>
<div>
       "There's something funny going on," he said, "I can just feel it in the air."
      </div>
<div>
       He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge a-was drunk,
      </div>
<div>
       As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk –
      </div>
<div>
       There was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       No one knew the circumstance, but they say that it happened pretty quick:
      </div>
<div>
       The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
      </div>
<div>
       And Big Jim was standing there – you couldn't say – surprised,
      </div>
<div>
       Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes –
      </div>
<div>
       She was with Big Jim, but she was leaning to the jack of hearts.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
      </div>
<div>
       And cleaned out the bank safe – it's said they got off with quite a haul.
      </div>
<div>
       In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
      </div>
<div>
       For one more member, who had business back in town,
      </div>
<div>
       For they couldn't go no further without the jack of hearts.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black,
      </div>
<div>
       Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back,
      </div>
<div>
       And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink,
      </div>
<div>
       The hanging judge a-was sober, he hadn't had a drink,
      </div>
<div>
       The only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       The cabaret was empty now, a sign said "Closed for Repair",
      </div>
<div>
       Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair.
      </div>
<div>
       She was thinking 'bout her father, who she very rarely saw,
      </div>
<div>
       Thinking 'bout Rosemary and thinking about the law,
      </div>
<div>
       But most of all she was thinking 'bout the jack of hearts.
