<p>
<div>
       Well, there was this movie I seen one time
      </div>
<div>
       About a man riding 'cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck.
      </div>
<div>
       He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
      </div>
<div>
       The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Well, the marshal, now, he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
      </div>
<div>
       As the dying gunfighter lay on the sun and gasped for his last breath.
      </div>
<div>
       "Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square.
      </div>
<div>
       I want him to feel what it's like to every moment face his death."
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
      </div>
<div>
       And, you know, it blows right through me like a ball and chain.
      </div>
<div>
       You know, I can't believe we've lived so long and are still so far apart,
      </div>
<div>
       The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       I can still see the day you came to me on the painted desert
      </div>
<div>
       In your busted down Ford and your platform heels.
      </div>
<div>
       I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet –
      </div>
<div>
       Ah, but you were right, it was perfect as I got in behind the wheel.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Well, we drove that car all night until we got into San Anton'
      </div>
<div>
       And we slept near the Alamo – your skin was so tender and soft.
      </div>
<div>
       Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back.
      </div>
<div>
       I would have gone on after you, but I didn't feel like letting my head get blown off.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Well, we're driving this car and the sun is coming up over the Rockies –
      </div>
<div>
       Now, I know she ain't you, but she's here and she's got that dark rhythm in her soul,
      </div>
<div>
       But I'm too over the edge and I ain't in the mood anymore
      </div>
<div>
       To remember the times when I was your only man
      </div>
<div>
       And she don't wanna remind me, she knows this car would go out of control.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
      </div>
<div>
       Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
      </div>
<div>
       Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
      </div>
<div>
       Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo.
      </div>
<div>
       We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live –
      </div>
<div>
       He owned a wrecking lot outside of town about a mile.
      </div>
<div>
       Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back,
      </div>
<div>
       She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust.
      </div>
<div>
       She says, "Henry ain't here, but you can come on in, he'll be back in a little while."
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Then she told us how times were tough
      </div>
<div>
       And about how she was thinking of bumming a ride back to from where she started,
      </div>
<div>
       But she changed the subject every time money came up.
      </div>
<div>
       She said, "Welcome to the land of the living dead",
      </div>
<div>
       But you could tell she was so broken-hearted,
      </div>
<div>
       She said, "Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt."
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       "How far are you all going?" Ruby asked us with a sigh.
      </div>
<div>
       "We going all the way till the wheels fall off and burn,
      </div>
<div>
       Till the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies."
      </div>
<div>
       Ruby just smiled and said, "Ah, you know some babies never learn."
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Something about that movie, though – but I just can't get it outta my head –
      </div>
<div>
       But I can't remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play.
      </div>
<div>
       All I remember about it was–is Gregory Peck and the way that people moved
      </div>
<div>
       And a lot of 'em, they seemed to be looking my way.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
      </div>
<div>
       Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
      </div>
<div>
       Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
      </div>
<div>
       Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour,
      </div>
<div>
       I was crossing the street when shots rang out.
      </div>
<div>
       I didn't know whether to duck or to run, so I ran.
      </div>
<div>
       "We got him cornered in the churchyard!" I heard somebody shout.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune,
      </div>
<div>
       Underneath it it said, "A man with no alibi".
      </div>
<div>
       You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you.
      </div>
<div>
       Then, when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears,
      </div>
<div>
       It was the best acting I saw anybody do.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Now, I've always been the kind of person that doesn't like to trespass,
      </div>
<div>
       But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.
      </div>
<div>
       Oh, if there's an original thought out there, I could use it right now,
      </div>
<div>
       You know, I feel pretty good, but that ain't saying much.
      </div>
<div>
       I could feel a whole lot better
      </div>
<div>
       If you were just here by my side to show me how.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Well, I'm standing in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck,
      </div>
<div>
       Yeah, but, you know, it's not the one that I had in mind.
      </div>
<div>
       He's got a new one out now, I don't even know what it's about,
      </div>
<div>
       But I'll see him in anything, so I'll stand in line.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
      </div>
<div>
       Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
      </div>
<div>
       Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
      </div>
<div>
       Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       You know, it's funny how things never turn out the way you had 'em planned.
      </div>
<div>
       The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter
      </div>
<div>
       Is that his name wasn't Henry Porter.
      </div>
<div>
       And, you know, there was something about you, baby,
      </div>
<div>
       That I liked, that was always too good for this world.
      </div>
<div>
       Just like you always said, there was something about me you liked
      </div>
<div>
       That I left in the French Quarter.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections
      </div>
<div>
       Than people who are most content.
      </div>
<div>
       I don't have any regrets – they can talk about me plenty when I'm gone.

       You always said people don't do what they believe in,
      </div>
<div>
       They just do what's most convenient, then they repent.
      </div>
<div>
       And I always said, "Hang on to me, baby, and let's hope that the roof stays on."

       There was a movie I seen one time – I think I sat through it twice,
      </div>

      </div>
<div>
       All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck,
      </div>
<div>
       He wore a gun and he was shot in the back.

       Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls,
      </div>
<div>
       Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above,
      </div>
<div>
       Brownsville girl, show me all around the world,
      </div>
<div>
       Brownsville girl, you're my honey, love.
