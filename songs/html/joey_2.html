<p>
<div>
       Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when,
      </div>
<div>
       Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion,
      </div>
<div>
       Always on the outside of whatever side there was,
      </div>
<div>
       When they asked him why it had to be that way, "Well," he answered, "just because."
      </div>
<div>
       Larry was the oldest, Joey was a-next to last,
      </div>
<div>
       They called Joe "Crazy", the baby they called "Kid Blast",
      </div>
<div>
       Some say they lived off gambling and running numbers too,
      </div>
<div>
       Seemed like always they'd be caught between the mob and the men in blue.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Joey, Joey,
      </div>
<div>
       King of the streets, child of clay,
      </div>
<div>
       Joey, Joey,
      </div>
<div>
       What made them want to come and blow you away?
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that,
      </div>
<div>
       No one really knew for sure wherever they were at.
      </div>
<div>
       They tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost a-hit the roof,
      </div>
<div>
       He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof.
      </div>
<div>
       When a horror<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a> broke out at the break of dawn and emptied out the streets,
      </div>
<div>
       Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats.
      </div>
<div>
       Well, they ventured out behind the line and took five prisoners,
      </div>
<div>
       Stashed 'em away in a basement, called 'em "amateurs".
      </div>
<div>
       The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim,
      </div>
<div>
       "Let's blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame."
      </div>
<div>
       But Joey stepped up and he raised his hands, said, "We're not those kind of men,
      </div>
<div>
       It's peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again."
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Joey, Joey,
      </div>
<div>
       King of the streets, child of clay,

<div>
       Joey, Joey,
      </div>
<div>
       What made them want to come and blow you away?
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       The police department hounded him and called him "Mr. Smith",
      </div>
<div>
       They got him on conspiracy, but they never said who with.
      </div>
<div>
       "What time is it?" said the judge to Joey when they met.
      </div>
<div>
       "Five to ten," said Joey. Judge says, "That's just what you get."
      </div>
<div>
       He did ten years in Attica, [incomprehensible]<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a> and Wilhelm Reich,
      </div>
<div>
       They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike,
      </div>
<div>
       His closest friends were black men 'cause they seemed to understand
      </div>
<div>
       What it's like to be in society with a shackle on your hand.
      </div>
<div>
       They let him out in '71, I swear he did look great,
      </div>
<div>
       He dressed like Jimmy Cagney, but he did – lost a little weight.
      </div>
<div>
       He tried to find a way back into where he left behind,
      </div>
<div>
       To the boss he said, "I have returned and now I want what's mine."
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Joey, Joey,
      </div>
<div>
       King of the streets, child of clay,

<div>
       Joey, Joey,
      </div>
<div>
       Why did they have to come blow you away?
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       It's true that in his later years he would not carry a gun:
      </div>
<div>
       "I'm around too many children," he said, "they should never know of one."
      </div>
<div>
       Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong, deadly foe
      </div>
<div>
       And emptied out the register, said, "Tell 'em it was Crazy Joe."
      </div>
<div>
       One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York,
      </div>
<div>
       He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork.
      </div>
<div>
       He pushed the table over to protect his family,
      </div>
<div>
       Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy.
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Joey, Joey,
      </div>
<div>
       King of the streets, child of clay,
      </div>
<div>
       Joey, Joey,
      </div>
<div>
       What made them want to come and blow you away?
      </div>
</p>
<p>
<div>
       Sister Jacqueline, sister Carmela, and mother Mary all did weep,
      </div>
<div>
       I heard his best friend, Frankie, say, "He ain't dead, he's just asleep",
      </div>
<div>
       Then I saw the old man's limousine head back towards the grave –
      </div>
<div>
       I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save.
      </div>
<div>
       The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned,
      </div>
<div>
       They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born.
      </div>
<div>
       Someday, if God's in heaven overlooking His preserve,
      </div>
<div>
       I know that the men that shot him down will get what they deserve.
      </div>

        Dylan definitely does not sing "war" here, as in the album version, but whether or not it's "horror" is only my best guess.

        I can't even be sure that Dylan says "reading" here and what used to be "Nietzsche" is now some other name or word, but what I can't tell. It almost sounds like Dylan says "Wilhelm" twice or at least a name that sounds like "Wilhelm".
