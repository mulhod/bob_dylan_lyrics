Well, that big dumb blonde with her wheel gorged,
Turtle, that friend of hers with his checks all forged
And his cheeks in a chunk, with his cheese in the cash,
They're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash.
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
It's that million dollar bash.

Everybody from right now to over there and back,
The louder they come, the bigger they crack.
Come, now, sweet cream, don't forget to flash,
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash.
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
It's that million dollar bash.

Well, I took my counselor out to the barn,
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn,
And along came Jones, emptied the trash,
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash.
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
It's that million dollar bash.

Well, I'm hitting it too hard, my stones won't take,
I get up in the morning, but it's too early to wake,
First it's hello, goodbye, then push, and then crash,
But we're all gonna make it at that million dollar bash.
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
It's that million dollar bash.

Well, I looked at my watch, I looked at my wrist,
I punched myself in the face with my fist,
I took my potatoes down to be mashed,
And I made it on over to that million dollar bash.
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee,
It's that million dollar bash.
