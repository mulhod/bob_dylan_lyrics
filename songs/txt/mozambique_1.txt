I like to spend some time in Mozambique,
The sunny sky is aqua-blue,
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek,
It's very nice to stay a week or two
And maybe fall in love, just me and you.

There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
And plenty time for good romance
And everybody likes to stop and speak,
To**1** give the special one you seek a chance
And maybe say hello with just a glance.

Lying next to her by the ocean,
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Whispering your secret emotion –
Magic in a magical land.
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique,
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
You turn around to take a final peek
And you see why it's so unique to be
Among the lovely people living free
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.

**1** Could be "they".
