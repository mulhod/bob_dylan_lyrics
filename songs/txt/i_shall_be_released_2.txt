They say everything can be replaced,
They say every distance is not near,
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.

They say every man needs protection,
They say that every man must fall,
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Somewhere so high above this wall.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.

Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
A man who swears he's not to blame.
All day long I hear him shouting so loud,
Just crying out that he was framed.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east.
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
