Woke up this morning feeling blue,
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I don't care what in the world you do.

I went back home, put on my tie,
Gonna get that girl that money will buy.
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I don't care what in the world you do.

She looked at me, begin to smile,
Said, “Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?”
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I don't care what in the world you do.

No, no, ma'am, I can't wait,
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date.
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I don't care what in the world you do.

I tell you something, tell you the facts:
You don't want me, give my money back.
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you,
I got blood in my eyes for you, baby,
I don't care what in the world you do.
