Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can't jump it.
Sometimes it gets so hard to see.
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet
With all these promises you left for me.
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?

Well, I waited for you when I was half sick.
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me.
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
You–when**1** you knew I had some other place to be.
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?

Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously,
But then now again not too many can be like you, fortunately.
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Were finally delivered down to the penitentiary.
But to live outside the law you must be honest.
I know you always say that you agree.
Alright, so, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?

Well, I don't know how it happened, but the riverboat captain, he knows my fate,
But everybody else – even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets.
The Persian drunkard, he follows me.
Yes, I can take him to your house, but I can't unlock it.
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key.
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?

Well, I been in jail where all the mail showed
That a man can't give his address out to bad company
And now I stand here looking at your yellow railroad
In the ruins of your balcony,
Wondering where you are tonight, sweet Marie.

**1** Dylan begins the line with "you", but then quickly starts the line over correctly.
