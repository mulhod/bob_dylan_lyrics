Heart of mine, be still,
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
Don't let her know,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Heart of mine.

Heart of mine, go back home,
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
Don't let her see,
Don't let her see where you're going,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Heart of mine.

Heart of mine, go back where you been,
Be only trouble for you if-a you let her in.
Don't let her know,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Heart of mine.

Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Give you an inch and you'll take the mile.
Don't let yourself fall,
Don't let yourself stumble,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Heart of mine,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Heart of mine,
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Heart of mine.
