Come, baby, find me, come, baby, remind me of where I once begun,
Come, baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one.
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors,
But I will always be emotionally yours.

Come, baby, rock me, come, baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart,
Come, baby, teach me, come, baby, reach me, let the music start.
I could be dreaming, but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for
And I will always be emotionally yours.

It's like my whole life never happened, when I see you it's as if I've never had a thought,
I know this dream, it might be crazy, but it's the only one I've got.

Come, baby, shake me, come, baby, take me, I would be satisfied,
Come, baby, hold me, come, baby, help me, my arms are open wide.
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores,
But I will always be emotionally yours.
