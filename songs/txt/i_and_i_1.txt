Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed.
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams.
In another lifetime, she must have owned the world or been faithfully wed
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.

I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."

Think I'll go out and go for a walk --
Not much happening here, nothing ever does.
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want me to talk.
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever was.

I and I, in creation where one's a-nature neither honors, nor forgives.
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."

Took an untrodden path once where the swift don't win the race.
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth.
Took a stranger to teach me to look into justice's beautiful face
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.

I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."

Outside of two men on a train platform, there's nobody in sight.
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track.
The world could come to an end tonight, but that's alright.
She should still be there sleeping when I get back.

I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
I and I, one said to the other, "No man sees my face and lives."

Noontime and I'm still pushing myself along the road -- the darkest part --
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put.
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening only to my heart.
I've made shoes for everyone -- even you -- while I still go barefoot.

I and I, in creation where one's nature neither honors, nor forgives.
I and I, one said to the other, "No man see my face and lives."
