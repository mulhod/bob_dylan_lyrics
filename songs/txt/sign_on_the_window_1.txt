Sign on a door said “No Company Allowed”,
Sign on a street says “You Don't Own Me”,
Sign on a porch says “Three's a Crowd”,

Her and her boyfriend went to California,
Her and her boyfriend done changed their tune.
My best friend said, “Now, didn't I warn you?
Brighton girls are like the moon,

Looks like a-nothing but rain,
Sure gonna be wet tonight on Main Street,
Hope that it don't sleet.

Build me a cabin in Utah,
Marry me a wife, catch rainbow trout,
Have a bunch of kids who call me “Pa” –
That must be what it's all about,
That must be what it's all about.
