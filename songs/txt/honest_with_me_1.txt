Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps,
Some of these women, they just give me the creeps.
I'm avoiding the south side the best I can,
These memories I got, they can strangle a man.

Well, I came ashore in the dead of the night,
Lot of things can get in the way when you're trying to do what's right.
You don't understand it, my feeling for you.
You'd be honest with me if you only knew.

I'm not sorry for nothing I've done,
I'm glad I fought, I only wish we'd won.
The Siamese twins are coming to town,
People can't wait, they're gathered around.

When I left my home, the sky split open wide,
I never wanted to go back there, I'd rather have died.
You don't understand it, my feeling for you.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.

My woman got a face like a teddy bear,
She's tossing a baseball bat in the air,
The meat is so tough you can't cut it with a sword,
I'm crashing my car trunk-first into the board.

You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice?
Well, I'll sell it to you at a reduced price.
You don't understand it, my feeling for you.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.

Some things are too terrible to be true,
I won't come here no more if it bothers you.
Well, the Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45,
I'm having a hard time believing some people were ever alive.

I'm stark naked, but I don't care,
I'm going off into the woods, I'm hunting bare**1**.
You don't understand it, my feeling for you.
You'd be honest with me if only you knew.

I'm here to create the new imperial empire,
I'm gon' do whatever circumstances require.
I care so much for you, didn't think I could,
I can't tell my heart that you're no good.

Well, my parents, they warned me not to waste my years
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears.
You don't understand it, my feeling for you.
Well, you'd be honest with me if only you knew.

**1** A pun as Dylan is hunting “bare” but could also be hunting “bear”.
