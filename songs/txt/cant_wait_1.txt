I can't wait, wait for you to change your mind,
It's late, I'm trying to walk the line.
Well, it's way past midnight and there's a-people all around,
Some on their way up, some on their way down,
The air burns and I'm trying to think straight,
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.

I'm your man, I'm trying to recover the sweet love that we knew.
You understand that my heart can't go on beating without you.
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I'm a-reeling from the blow,
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so.
I'm breathing hard, standing at the gate,
Oh, but I don't know how much longer I can wait.

Skies are gray, I'm looking for anything that'll bring a happy glow,
Night or day, it doesn't matter where I go anymore, I just go.
If I ever saw you coming, I don't know what I might do,
I'd like to think I could control myself, but it isn't true.
That's how it is when things disintegrate,
And I don't know how much longer I can wait.

I'm doomed to love you, I've been rolling through stormy weather.
I'm thinking of you and all the places we could roam together.

It's mighty funny, the end of time has just begun,
Oh, honey, after all these years you're still the one.
Well, I'm strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind,
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line,
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate.
I don't know how much longer I can wait.
