Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Swamp's gonna rise, no boat's gonna row.
Now, you can train on down to Williams Point,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
But, oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.

Now, don't you try and move me, you're just gonna lose,
There's a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
Well, it's sugar for sugar, it's salt for salt,
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.

Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
Now, it's king for king, queen for queen,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's seen,
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
Yes, you gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
