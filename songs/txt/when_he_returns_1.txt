The iron hand, it ain't no match for the iron rod,
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty god.
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears,
It is only He who can reduce me to tears.
Don't you cry and don't you die and don't you burn:
Like a thief in the night He'll replace wrong with right when He returns.

Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through,
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew.
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Will I ever learn that there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease until He returns?

Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take up off your mask,
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask.
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Of every earthly plan that be known to man He is unconcerned,
He's got plans of His own to set up His throne when a-He returns.
