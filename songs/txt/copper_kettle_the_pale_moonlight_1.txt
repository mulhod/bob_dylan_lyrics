Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil,
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil,
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.

Build you a fire with hickory – hickory, ash, and oak,
Don't use no green or rotten wood – they'll get you by the smoke,
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight.

My daddy, he made whiskey, my granddaddy, he did, too,
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792.
We'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright,
Watch them jugs a-filling in the pale moonlight,
In the pale moonlight.
