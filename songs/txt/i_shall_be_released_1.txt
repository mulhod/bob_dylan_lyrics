They say every man must need protection,
They say every man must fall,
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above the wall.
I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.

Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
There's a man who swears he's not to blame.
All day long I hear him cry so loud,
Calling out that he's been framed.
Yeah, I see my light come shining from the west out to the east,
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
