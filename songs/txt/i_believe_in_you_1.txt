They ask me how I feel
And if my love is real
And how I know I'll make it through
And they––they look at me and frown,
They'd like to drive me from this town,
They don't want me around 'cause I believe in you.

They––they show me to the door,
They say don't come back no more
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
And I––I walk out on my own,
A thousand miles from home,
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe in you.

I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter,
I believe in you even though we be apart,
I believe in you even on the morning after,
Oh, when the dawn is nearing,
Oh, when the night is disappearing,
Oh, this feeling's still here in my heart.
Don't let me drift too far,
Keep me where you are,
Where I will always be renewed,
And that which you've given me today
Is worth more than I could pay
And, no matter what they say, I believe in you.

I believe in you when winter turns––turns to summer,
I believe in you when white turn to black,
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered,
Oh, though the earth may shake me,
Oh, though my friends forsake me,
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back.
Don't let me change my heart,
Keep me set apart
From all the plans they do pursue
And I––I don't mind the pain,
Don't mind the driving rain,
I know I will sustain 'cause I believe in you.
