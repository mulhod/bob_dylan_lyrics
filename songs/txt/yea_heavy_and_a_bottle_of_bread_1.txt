Well, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
The poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!

It's a one-track town, just brown and a breeze, too,
Pack up the meat, sweet, we're heading out
For Wichita in a pile of fruit,
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!
Get the loot, don't be slow, we're gonna catch a trout!

Now, pull that drummer out from behind that bottle,
Bring me my pipe, we're gonna shake it,
Slap that drummer with a pie that smells,
Take me down to California, baby!
Take me down to California, baby!
Take me down to California, baby!
Take me down to California, baby!

Yes, the comic book and me, just us, we caught the bus,
Poor little chauffeur, though, she was back in bed
On the very next day with a nose full of pus,
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
Yea heavy, and a bottle of bread!
