I'm walking through streets that are dead,
Walking–walking with you in my head,
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired, and the clouds are weeping.

Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Did I hear someone's distant cry?
I spoke like a child, you destroyed me with a smile while I was sleeping.

I'm sick of love, that I'm in the thick of it,
This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.

I see–I see lovers in the meadow,
I see–I see silhouettes in the window,
I watch them till they're gone and they leave me hanging on to the shadow.

I'm sick of love, I hear the clock tick,
This kind of love, I–I'm lovesick.

Sometimes the silence can be like thunder,
Sometimes I wanna take to the road and plunder.
Could you ever be true? I think of you and I wonder.

I'm sick of love, I wish I'd never met you,
I'm sick of love, I'm trying to forget you.

Just don't know what to do,
I'd give anything to be with you.
