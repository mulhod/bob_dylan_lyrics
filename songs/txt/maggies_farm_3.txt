I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands, and pray for rain,
Got a head full of ideas that are driving me insane,
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor.

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
He hands you a nickel and he hands you a dime,
Asks you with a grin, “Are you having a good time?”
Then he fines you every time you slam the door.

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Talks to servants about man and God and law,
Everybody says he's the brains behind ma,
68, but says he's 24.

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Well, she puts her cigar out in my face just for kicks,
Her bedroom window, it is made outta bricks,
The National Guard stands around the**1** door.

I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
I try my best to be just like I am,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
They say, “Sing while you slave!” I get bored.

<i>Thank you, that was called “Maggie's Farm”.</i>

**1** Dylan cleverly switches the subjects of this verse and the previous verse with each other, but, as a vestige of the original lyrics, he might have forgotten to switch "his" to "the" (or something else) in "[t]he National Guard stands around his door".
