Look out across the fields, see me returning,
Smoke is in your eyes, you draw a smile
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning,
You've had time to think about it for a while.
Well, I've walked two hundred miles, look me over,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
It won't matter who loves who – you'll love me or I'll love you –
When the night comes falling,
When the night comes falling,
When the night comes falling from the sky.

I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
With disaster you somehow managed to escape.
I can't provide for you no easy answers.
Who are you that I should have to lie?
You'll know all about it, love, it'll fit you like a glove
When the night comes falling,
When the night comes falling,
When the night comes falling from the sky.

I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river,
You must have been protecting someone last time I called,
I never asked you for nothing that you couldn't deliver,
I never asked you to set yourself up for a fall.
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness,
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
When the night comes falling,
When the night comes falling,
When the night comes falling from the sky.

In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line,
I don't wanna be a fool starving for affection,
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
For all eternity I think I will remember
That icy wind that's howling in your eye,
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
When the night comes falling,
When the night comes falling,
When the night comes falling from the sky.

Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter,
But you were gambling for support,
This time tomorrow I'll know you better
When my memory is not so short.
This time I'm asking for freedom,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
And you'll give it to me now, I'll take it anyhow
When the night comes falling,
When the night comes falling,
When the night comes falling from the sky.
