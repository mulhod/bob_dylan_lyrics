Heart of mine, be still,
You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill.
Don't let her know,
Don't let her know that you love her,
Don't be a fool, don't be blind,
Heart of mine.

Heart of mine, go back home,
You got no reason to wander, no reason to roam.
Don't let her see,
Don't let her see that you need her,
Don't put yourself over the line,
Heart of mine.

Heart of mine, go back where you been,
It only trouble for you if you let her in.
Don't let her hear,
Don't let her hear where you're going,
Don't untie the ties that bind,
Heart of mine.

Heart of mine, so malicious and so full of guile,
Give you an inch and you'll take a mile.
Don't let yourself fall,
Don't let yourself stumble,
You can't do the time, don't do the crime,
Heart of mine.
