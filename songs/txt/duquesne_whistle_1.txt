Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away.
I'm gonna stop at Carmangale and keep on going,
That Duquesne train gon' rock me night and day.
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp,
But I ain't neither one.
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Sound like it's on a final run.

Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Blowing like she never blowed before,
Little light blinking, red light glowing,
Blowing like she's at my chamber door.
You smiling through the fence at me
Just like you've always smiled before.
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more.

Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart.
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going,
You're like a time bomb in my heart.
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling,
Must be the mother of Our Lord.
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Blowing like my woman's on board.

Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away.
You're a rascal, I know exactly where you're going,
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day.
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed,
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head.
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead.
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Blowing through another no-good town.

The lights on my native land are glowing,
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round.
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing,
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb.
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing,
Blowing like she's blowing right on time.
