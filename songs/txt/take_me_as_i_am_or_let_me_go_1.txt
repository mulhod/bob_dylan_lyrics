Why must you always try to make me over?
Take me as I am or let me go.
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover,
Take me as I am or let me go.

You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
In the image of someone you used to know,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Take me as I am or let me go.

You've tried to change me ever since you've met me,
Take me as I am or let me go.
If you cannot overlook my faults, forget me:
Take me as I am or let me go.

You're trying to reshape me in a mold, love,
In the image of someone you used to know,
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love,
Take me as I am or let me go.
