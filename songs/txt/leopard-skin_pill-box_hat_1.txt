Well, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat,
Yes, I see you got your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
Well, you must tell me, baby, how your head feels under something like that,
Under your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.

Well, you look so pretty in it. Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Yes, I just wanna see if it's really the expensive kind.
You know, it balances on your head just like a mattress balances on a bottle of wine,
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.

Well, if you wanna see the sunrise, honey, I know where.
We'll go out and see it sometime, we'll both just sit there and stare,
Me with my belt wrapped around my head and you just sitting there
In your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.

Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you. “It's bad for your health,” he said.
Yes, I disobeyed his orders, I came to see you, but I found him there instead.
You know, I don't mind him cheating on me, but I sure wish he'd take that off his head,
Your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.

Well, I see you got a new boyfriend, no, I never seen him before.
Well, I saw you making love with him, you forgot to close the garage door.
You might think he loves you for your money, but I know what he really loves you for,
It's your brand-new leopard-skin pill-box hat.
