Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
They'll stone you just like they said they would,
They'll stone you when you're trying to go home,
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone.
But I would not feel so all alone,
Everybody must get stoned.

Well, they'll stone you when you're walking on the street,
They'll stone you when you're trying to keep your seat,
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor,
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door.
But I would not feel so all alone,
Everybody must get stoned.

They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
They'll stone you when you are young and able,
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a buck,
They'll stone you and then they'll say, “Good luck.”
Yeah, but I would not feel so all alone,
Everybody must get stoned.

Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end,
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again.
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car,
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar.
Yes, but I would not feel so all alone,
Everybody must get stoned.
Alright!

Well, they'll stone you when you are all alone,
They'll stone you when you are walking home,
They'll stone you and then say, “You are brave,”
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave.
But I would not feel so all alone,
Everybody must get stoned.
