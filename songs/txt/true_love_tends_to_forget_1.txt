I'm getting weary looking in my baby's eyes,
When she's near me, she's so hard to recognize,
But I finally realize there's no room for regret:
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.

Hold me, baby, be near,
You told me that you'd be sincere,
But every day of the year like playing Russian roulette.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.

I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
I saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
You're a tearjerker, baby, but I'm under your spell,
You're a hard worker, baby, but I know you well
And this weekend in hell is making me sweat.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.

I was lying down in the reeds without any oxygen,
I saw you in the wilderness among the men,
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again,
All you got to do is wait and I'll tell you when.
You belong to me, baby, without a doubt,
Don't forsake me, baby, don't sell me out,
Don't keep me knocking about from Mexico to Tibet.
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget,
True love, true love, true love tends to forget.
