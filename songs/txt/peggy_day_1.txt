Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
By golly, what more can I say?
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.

Peggy Night makes my future look so bright.
Man, that girl is out of sight.
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night.

Well, you know––even**1** before I learned her name,
You know, I loved her just the same.
And I tell 'em all wherever I may go just so they'll know
That she's my little lady and I love her so.

Peggy Day stole my poor heart away,
Turned my skies to blue from gray.
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.

Peggy Day stole my poor heart away.
By golly, what more can I say?
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day,
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day.

**1** The dashes here indicate the presence of mumbled singing. It sounds as though Dylan begins to say “even”, but he trails off perhaps because it would've been too early rhythmically to start the rest of the line or because Dylan meant to say something else (like “that”, as the official lyrics say).
