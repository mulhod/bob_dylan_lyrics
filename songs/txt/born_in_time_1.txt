In the lonely night,
In the blinking stardust of a pale-blue light,
You're coming through to me in black and white when we were made of dreams.

You're blowing down the shaky street,
You're hearing my heart beat
In the record-breaking heat where we were born in time.

Not one more night, not one more kiss,
Not this time, baby, no more of this.
Takes too much skill, takes too much will, it's too revealing.
You came, you saw, just like the law,
You married young just like your ma,
You tried and tried, you made me slide, you left me reeling with this feeling.

On the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,
You don't get anything you don't deserve where we were born in time.

You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,
You hang the flame, you pay the price,
Oh, babe, that fire is still smoking.
You were snow, you were rain,
You were striped, you were plain,
Oh, babe, truer words have not been spoken or broken.

In the hills of mystery,
In the foggy web of destiny,
You can have what's left of me where we were born in time.
