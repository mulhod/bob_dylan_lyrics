Oh, God said to Abraham, “Kill me a son.”
Abe said, “Man, you must be putting me on.”
God said, “No.” Abe said, “What?”
God said, “You can do what you want, Abe, but
The next time you see me coming you better run.”
Well, Abe said, “Where you want this killing done?”
God said, “Oh, down Highway 61.”

Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Welfare Department, they wouldn't give him no clothes.
He asked poor Howard, “Where can I go?”
Howard said, “There's only one place I know.”
Sam said, “Tell me quick, man! I got to run.”
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun
And said, “That way down Highway 61.”

Well, Mack the Finger said to Louis the King,
“I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring.
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?”
And Louis the King said, “Let me think for a minute, son.”
Then he said, “Yes, I think it can be easily done.
Just take everything down to Highway 61.”

Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren't right.
“My complexion,” she says, “is much too white.”
He said, “Come here and step into the light.”
He says, “Hmm, you're right. Let me tell the second mother this has been done.”
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61.

Now, the roving gambler, he was very bored
Trying to create a next world war.
He found a promoter, who nearly fell off the floor.
He said, “I never engaged in this kind of thing before,
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And have it on Highway 61.”
