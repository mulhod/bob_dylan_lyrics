I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun,
A few stolen kisses and no harm was done.
'Steada stopping when we could, we went right on
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.

You belong to someone else and I do too,
It's just crazy being here with you
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.

I didn't want to want you, now I have no choice,
It's too late to listen to that warning voice,
All I hear is thunder of two hearts' beat
Doing ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.

You're not free to belong to me
And you know I could never be your own,
Your lips on mine are like sweet, sweet wine,
But we're heading for a wall of stone.

Warning signs are eve–flashing**1** everywhere, but we pay no heed,
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a-picking up speed,
Disaster's getting closer at every time we meet
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street,
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead-end street.

**1** Dylan begins to say “everywhere”, but catches himself and switches to the word “flashes”.
