I think we better talk this over,
Maybe when we both get sober,
You'll understand I'm only a man doing the best that I can.

This situation can only get rougher,
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways before we decay.

You don't have to be afraid of looking a-into my face,
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.**1**

I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling:
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance of a downhill dance.

Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
I'm exiled, you can't convert me,
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways with both eyes glazed.

You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.

I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
If I have to beg, steal, or borrow,
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half, look at each other and laugh.

But I don't think it's liable to happen –
Like the sound of a-one hand clapping:
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept 'neath the bed where we slept.

Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.

Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.

Oh, baby, time for a new transition,
I wish I a-was a magician,
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond that we've both gone beyond.

**1** After "erase" at the end of this line, Dylan seems to say something else quietly, but it may just be an interjection.
