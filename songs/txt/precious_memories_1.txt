As I travel down life's pathway,
Know not what the years may hold.
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder,
Precious memories flood my soul.

Precious memories, how they linger,
How they ever flood my soul!
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.

Precious father, loving mother,
Glide across the lonely years
And old homes, scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appear.

Precious memories, how they linger,
How they ever flood my soul!
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.

Precious memories, how they linger,
How they ever flood my soul!
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.
