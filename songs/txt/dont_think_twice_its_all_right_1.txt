Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
If'n you don't know by now.
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe –
It'll never do, somehow.
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Look out your window and I'll be gone.
You're the reason I'm traveling on,
But don't think twice, it's alright.

And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
The light I never knowed.
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe –
I'm on the dark side of the road.
But I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay.
But we never did too much talking, anyway.
But don't think twice, it's alright.

So, it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal,
Like you never done before.
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal –
I can't hear you anymore.
I'm thinking and wondering, walking down the road.
I once loved a woman – a child, I am told.
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul.
But don't think twice, it's alright.

So long, honey babe.
Where I'm bound I can't tell.
Goodbye's too good a word, babe,
So I'll just say “Fare thee well”.
I ain't saying you treated me unkind.
You coulda done better, but I don't mind.
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
But don't think twice, it's alright.
