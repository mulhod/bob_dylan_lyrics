Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
Cannot hold you to its heat.
Your temperature is too hot for taming.
Your flaming feet are burning up the street.
I am homeless, come and take me
To reach of your rattling drums.
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
Down along my restless palms.

Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
I have fallen far beneath
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing,
And your flashing diamond teeth.
The night is pitch-black, come and make my
Pale face fit into place, oh, please!
Let me know, babe – I'm nearly drowning –
If it's you my lifelines trace.

I been wondering all about me
Ever since I seen you there.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding.
I know I'm 'round you, but I don't know where.
You have slayed me, you have made me.
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
I got to know, babe: will you surround me
So I can know if I'm really real?
