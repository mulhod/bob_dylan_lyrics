Hawlin Alley on a dark and drizzly night,
Billy Lyons and Stack-A-Lee had one terrible fight.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.

Stack-A-Lee walked to the bar-room and he called for a glass of beer,
Turned around to Billy Lyons, said, “What are you doing here?”
“Waiting for a train, please bring my woman home.”

“Stack-A-Lee, oh, Stack-A-Lee, please don't take my life.
Got three little children and a weeping, loving wife.
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee.”

“God bless your children and I'll take care of your wife,
You stole my John B., now I'm bound to take your life.”
All about that John B. Stetson hat.

Stack-A-Lee turned to Billy Lyons and he shot him right through the head,
Only taking one shot to kill Billy Lyons dead.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.

Sent for the doctor, well, the doctor, he did come,
Just pointed out Stack-A-Lee, said, “Now what have you done?
You're a bad man, bad man, Stack-A-Lee.”

Six big horses and a rubber-tired hack
Taking him to the cemetery, but they failed to bring him back.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.

Hawlin Alley, I thought I heard a bulldog bark,
Must've been old Stack-A-Lee stumbling in the dark.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.

High police walked on to Stack-A-Lee, he was lying fast asleep,
High police get Stack-A-Lee and a-he jumped forty feet.
He's a bad man, gonna land him right back in jail.

Well, they got old Stack-A-Lee and they lied him right back in jail,
Couldn't get a man around to go Stack-A Lee's bail.
All about that John B. Stetson hat.

Stack-A-Lee turned to the jailer, he said, “Jailer, I can't sleep,
'Round my bedside Billy Lyons has began to creep.”
All about that John B. Stetson hat.
