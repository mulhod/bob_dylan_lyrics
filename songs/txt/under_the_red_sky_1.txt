There was a little boy and there was a little girl
And they lived in an alley under the red sky,
There was a little boy and there was a little girl
And they lived in an alley under the red sky.

There was an old man and he lived in the moon,
One summer's day he came passing by,
There was an old man and he lived in the moon
And one day he came passing by.

Someday, little girl, everything for you is gonna be new,
Someday, little girl, you'll have a–a diamond as big as your shoe.

Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high,
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie,
Let the wind blow low and the wind blow high,
One day the little boy and little girl were baked in a pie.

This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town,
This is the blind horse that leads you around.

Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry,
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly,
Man in the moon went home and the river went dry.
