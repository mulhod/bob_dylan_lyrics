I'll remember you
When I've forgotten all the rest.
You to me were true,
You to me were the best.
When there is no more,
You cut to the core
Quicker than anyone I knew.
When I'm all alone
In the great unknown,
I'll remember you.

I'll remember you
At the end of the trail.
I had so much left to do,
I had so little time to fail.
There's some people that
You don't forget
Even though you only seen 'em one time or two.
When the roses fade
And I'm in the shade,
I'll remember you.

Didn't I–didn't I try to love you?
Didn't I–didn't I try to care?
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
With the rain blowing in your hair, oh?

I'll remember you
When the wind blows through the piney wood.
It was you who came right through,
It was you who understood.
Though I'd never say
That I done it the way
That you'd have liked me to,
In the end,
My dear, sweet friend,
I'll remember you.
