My heart is telling me I love you still.

I can see the turning of the key,
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me,
I thought that he was righteous, but he's vain,
Oh, something's telling me I wear the ball and chain.

My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost,
He's always off somewhere when I need him most,
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill,
But my heart is telling me I love you still.

I come back to the town from the flaming moon
And I see you in the street, I begin to swoon,
I love to see you dress before the mirror –
Won't you let me in your room one time before I finally disappear?

Everybody's wearing a disguise
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes,
But me, I can't cover what I am,
Wherever the children go, I'll follow them.

I march in the parade of liberty,
But, as long as I love you, I'm not free.
How long must I suffer such abuse?
Won't you let me see your smile before I turn you loose?

I've given up the game, I've got to leave,
The pot of gold is only make-believe,
The treasure can't be found by men who search,
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.

We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,
I asked you, please, to cross me off your list,
My head tells me it's time to make a change,
But my heart is telling me I love you, but you're strange.

Oh, one more time at midnight near the wall,
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.
Won't you descend from the throne from where you sit?
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.
