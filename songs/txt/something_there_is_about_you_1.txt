Something there is about you that strikes a match in me –
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be,
Something that's crossed over from another century?

Thought I'd shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth –
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walking the hills of old Duluth,
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black nights, and then there was Ruth.
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth.

Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings,
Don't have to look no further – you're the soul of many things.
I could say that I'd be faithful – I could say it in one sweet, easy breath,
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death.

Something there is about you that moves with style and grace.
I was in a whirlwind, now I'm in some better place,
My hand's on the saber and you've picked up on the baton,
Something there is about you that I can't quite put my finger on.
