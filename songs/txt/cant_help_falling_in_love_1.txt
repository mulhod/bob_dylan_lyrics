Wise men say only fools rush in,
But I can't help falling in love with you.
Shall I stay, would it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you?

Like a river flows surely to the sea,
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.
Take my hand, take a-my whole life, too,
For I can't help falling in love with you.
