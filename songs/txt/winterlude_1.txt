Winterlude, Winterlude, oh, darling,
Winterlude by the road tonight,
Tonight there will be no quarreling,
Everything is gonna be alright.
Oh, I see by the angel beside me that love has a reason to shine,
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more, Winterlude**1**, this dude thinks you're fine.

Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple,
Winterlude by the corn in the field,
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel,
Then come back and cook up a meal.
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens by the sun near the old crossroads sign,
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine.

Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy,
Winterlude by the telephone wire,
Winterlude, it's making me lazy,
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire.
The moonlight reflects from the window, where the snowflakes, they cover the sand,
Come out tonight, everything'll be tight, Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand.

**1** Dylan gets tripped up right here, saying something beginning with <i>th</i> (probably in anticipation of “this guy”, which comes directly after “Winterlude”) before cutting into “Winterlude” and the rest of the line. Other sources have the false start as “then”, which does not seem to fit with the meaning of the line.
