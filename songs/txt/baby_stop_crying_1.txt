You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe,
But you're back where you belong.
Go get me my pistol, babe,
Honey, I can't**1** tell right from wrong.

Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Baby, please stop crying,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.

Go down to the river, babe,
Honey, I will meet you there,
Go down to the river, babe,
Honey, I will pay your fare.

Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Baby, please stop crying,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.

If you're looking for assistance, babe,
Or if you just want some company
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to,
Honey, come and see about me.

Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Baby, please stop crying,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
But, baby, please stop crying 'cause it's tearing up my mind.

You been hurt so many times
And I know what you're thinking of,
Well, I don't have to be no doctor, babe,
To see that you're madly in love.

But, baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying,
Baby, please stop crying,
You know I know the sun will always shine,
But, baby, please stop crying––it's tearing up my mind.

**1** Dylan actually does not clearly say "can't" here ("can't" being in the official version of the lyrics), but I leave it as is because what he seems to say would make no sense and because I believe there's a chance that he just messes up the word. However, what Dylan seems to say is something like "ain't".
