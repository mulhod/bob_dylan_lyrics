So, run here, baby, put your little hands in mine,
I've got something to tell you, I know you're gonna change your mind.
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
It hurts me, too.

I want you, baby, just to understand
I don't wanna be your boss, baby, I just wanna be your man.
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
It hurts me, too.

Now, when you go home, you don't have to get along,
Come back to me, baby, where I live, that's where you belong.
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
It hurts me, too.

I love you, baby, and you know that it's true,
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby, nothing in this world is like you.
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
It hurts me, too,
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you,
It hurts me, too.

So, run here, baby, put your little hand in mine,
I've got something to tell you, baby, I know that will change your mind.
When things go wrong, so wrong with you,
Don't you know it––don't you know it hurts me, too?
