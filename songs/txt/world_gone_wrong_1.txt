Strange things have happened than ever before,
My baby told me I would have to go.
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
I can't be good, baby,
Honey, because the world gone wrong.

Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home,
No use in worrying 'cause the world gone wrong.
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
I can't be good, baby,
Honey, because the world done wrong.

I told you, baby, right to your head,
If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead.
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
I can't be good, baby,
Honey, 'cause the world gone wrong.

I tried to be loving and treat you kind,
But it seem like you're never right, you got no loyal mind.
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
I can't be good, baby,
Honey, 'cause the world's gone wrong.

If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind,
Praise the good lord to get her out of your mind.
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
I can't be good, baby,
Honey, because the world gone wrong.

Said when you been good now, can't do no more,
Just tell her kindly, “There is the front door.”
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
I can't be good, baby,
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.

Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat,
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back.
I can't be good no more once like I did before,
I can't be good, baby,
Honey, because the world gone wrong.
