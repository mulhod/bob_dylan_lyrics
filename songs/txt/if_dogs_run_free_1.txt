If dogs run free, why not we
Across the swooping plain?
My ears hear a symphony
Of two mules, trains, and rain.
The best is always yet to come – that's what they explain to me,
Just do your thing, you'll be king if dogs run free.

If dogs run free, why not me
Across the swamp of time?
My mind weaves a symphony
And tapestry of rhyme.
Oh, winds, which rush my tale to thee, so it may flow and be,
To each his own, it's all unknown if dogs run free.

If dogs run free, then what must be
Must be and that is all.
True love can make a blade of grass
Stand up straight and tall,
In harmony with the cosmic sea, true love needs no company:
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole if dogs run free.
