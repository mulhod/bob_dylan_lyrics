Well, I'll sing you a song – it ain't very long –
About an old man, he never done wrong.
How he died nobody can say,
They found him dead in the street one day.

Well, the crowd gathered one fine morn
At the man whose clothes and shoes were torn.
There on the sidewalk he did lay,
They stopped and stared and they went their way.

Well, the policeman come and he looked around.
“Get up, old man, or I'm taking you down.”
He jabbed him once with his bully club**1**,
The old man then rolled off the curb.

Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said,
“Call the wagon, this man is dead.”
The wagon come, they loaded him in,
I never saw the man again.

Well, I've sung you my song – it ain't very long –
About an old man that never done wrong.
How he died nobody could say,
They found him dead in the street one day.

**1** Of course what's meant here is “billy club”. However, Dylan pronounces “billy” as “bully” either by mistake or intentionally (in that the officer is using his club in a bullying manner).
