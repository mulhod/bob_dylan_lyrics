A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
And I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.

I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
When she's better only time'll tell.
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
And I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.

My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws**1** and rolls and flows
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.

I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
I didn't go to sleep last night.
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.

I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
What else can a poor boy do?
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be a-flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
