Go 'head and talk about him because he makes you doubt,
Because he has denied himself the things that you can't live without,
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do,
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through.
He's the property of Jesus,
Resent him to the bone,
You got something better,
You got a heart of stone.

Stop your conversation when he passes on the street,
Hope he falls upon himself – oh, won't that be sweet? –
Because he can't be exploited by superstition anymore,
Because he can't be bribed or bought by the things that you adore.
He's the property of Jesus,
Resent him to the bone,
You got something better,
You got a heart of stone.

When the whip that's a-keeping you in line doesn't make him jump,
Say he's hard of hearing, say that he's a chump,
Say he outta step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Because he doesn't pay tribute to the king that you serve.
He's the property of Jesus,
Resent him to the bone,
You got something better,
You got a heart of stone.

Say that he's a loser 'cause he got no common sense,
Because he don't increase his worth at someone else's expense,
Because he's not afraid of trying, say he's got no style,
'Cause he doesn't tell you jokes and fairy-tales, say he's failed to make you smile.
But he's the property of Jesus,
Resent him to the bone,
You got something better,
You got a heart of stone.

Well, you can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games,
You think that, when you rest at last, you'll go back from where you came,
But you've picked up quite a story and you've changed since the womb,
What happened to the real you? You've been captured, but by whom?
He's the property of Jesus,
Resent him to the bone,
You got something better,
You got a heart of stone.

He's the property of Jesus,
Resent him to the bone,
You got something better,
You got a heart of stone.
