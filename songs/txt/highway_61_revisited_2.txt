God said to Abraham, “Kill me a son.”
Abe said, “Man, you must be putting me on.”
God said, “No.” Abe said, “What?”
God said, “You can do what you want, Abe, but
The next time you see me coming you better run.”
Abe said, “Where you want this killing done?”
God said, “Out on Highway 61.”

Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose,
Welfare Department wouldn't give him no clothes.
He asked poor Howard, “Where can I go?”
And Howard said, “There's only one place I know.”
And Sam said, “Well, tell me quick, man – I got to run!”
And Old Howard just pointed off with his gun:
“That way down Highway 61.”

Well, the––Mack the Finger**1** said to Louis the King,
“I got forty red, white, and blue shoestrings
And a thousand telephones that don't ring –
Do you know where I can possibly get rid of these things?”
And Louis the King said, “Let me think for a minute, son.”
And then, “Yeah, I think it can be easily done:
Take it on down to Highway 61.”

Well, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told her first own father that things weren't right:
“My complexion,” she said, “ – much too white.”
“Come on over here, girl, and step into this light – ahh, you're right,
Let me tell the second mother this has been done.”
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61.

The roving gambler was a-very bored,
Tried to create a next world war.
Ohh, he found a promoter, nearly fell on the floor:
“No, I never did engage in this a-kinda thing before,
But, yes, I think it can be very easily done.
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun,
Have it on Highway 61.”

**1** Probably anticipating “the” from “Mack the Finger”, Dylan seems to accidentally begin with “the” before getting back on track.
