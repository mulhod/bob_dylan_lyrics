Standing on your window, honey – yes, I've been here before.
Feeling so harmless, I'm looking at your second door.
How come you don't send me no regards?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?

Kneeling 'neath your ceiling – yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
I'm trying to read your portrait, but I'm helpless like a rich man's child.
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
You know I want your loving. Honey, why are you so hard?

Like a poor fool in his prime, yes, I know you can hear me walk.
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime, or is it just solid rock?

Well, I lean into your hallway, lean against your velvet door.
I watch upon your scorpion, who crawls across your circus floor.
Just what do you think you have to guard?
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.

Achilles is in your alleyway, he don't want me here, he does brag.
He's pointing to the sky and he's hungry like a man in drag.
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
You know I want your loving, honey, but you're so hard.
