Something is burning, baby, are you aware?
Something is the matter, baby, there's smoke in your hair.
Are you still my friend, baby? Show me a sign.
Is the love in your heart for me turning blind?

You've been avoiding the main streets for a long, long while,
The truth that I'm seeking is in your missing file.
What's your position, baby? What's going on?
Why is the light in your eyes nearly gone?

I know everything about this place – or so it seems –
But am I no longer a part of your plans or your dreams?
Well, it is so obvious that something has changed:
What's happening, baby, to make you act so strange?

Something is burning, baby, here's what I say,
Even the bloodhounds of London couldn't find you today.
I see the shadow of a man, baby, making you blue.
Who is he, baby, and what's he to you?

We've reached the edge of the road, baby, where the pasture begins,
Where charity is supposed to cover up a multitude of sins,
But where do you live, baby, and where is the light?
Why are your eyes just staring off in the night?

I can feel it in the night, in the night, in the night when I think of you,
I can feel it in the light, in the light, in the light and it's got to be true.
You can't live by bread alone, you won't be satisfied,
You can't roll away the stone if your hands are tied.

Got to start some place, baby. Can you explain?
Please don't fade away on me, baby, like the midnight train.
Answer me, baby – a casual look will do:
Just what in the world has come over you?

I can feel it in the wind, in the wind, in the wind and it's upside down,
I can feel it in the dust as I get off the bus on the outskirts of town.
I've had the Mexico City blues since the last hairpin curve,
I don't wanna see you bleed, I know what you need and it ain't what you deserve.

Something is burning, baby, something's in flames,
There's a man going 'round calling names.
Ring down when you're ready, baby, I'm waiting for you,
I believe in the impossible, you know that I do.
