I am a lonesome hobo without family or friends.
Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends.
I have tried my hand at bribery, blackmail, and deceit.
And I've served time for everything 'cept begging on the street.

Well, once I was rather prosperous, there was nothing I did lack.
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth and silk upon my back.
But I did not trust my brother, I carried him to blame,
Which led me to my fatal doom, to wander off in shame.

Kind ladies and kind gentlemen, soon I will be gone.
But, let me just warn you all before I do pass on:
Stay free from petty jealousies, live by no man's code,
And hold your judgment for yourself lest you wind up on this road.
