Hazel, dirty-blonde hair,
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere,
You got something I want plenty of,
Ooh, a little touch of your love.

Hazel, stardust in your eye,
You're going somewhere and so am I,
I'd give you the sky high above,
Ooh, for the touch of your love.

Oh, no, I don't need any reminder
To know how much I really care,
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.

Hazel, you called and I came,
Now, don't make me play this waiting-game.
You got something I want plenty of,
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
