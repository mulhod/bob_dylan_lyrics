Don't wanna judge nobody, don't wanna be judged,
Don't wanna touch nobody, don't wanna be touched,
Don't wanna hurt nobody, don't wanna be hurt,
Don't wanna treat nobody like they was dirt,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.

Don't wanna shoot nobody, don't wanna be shot,
Don't wanna buy nobody, don't wanna be bought,
Don't wanna bury nobody, don't wanna be buried,
Don't wanna marry nobody if they're already married,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.

Don't wanna burn nobody, don't wanna be burned,
Don't wanna learn from nobody what I gotta unlearn,
Don't wanna cheat nobody, I don't wanna be cheated,
Don't wanna defeat nobody if already been defeated,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.

Don't wanna wink at nobody, I don't wanna be winked at,
Don't wanna be used by nobody for a doormat,
Don't wanna confuse nobody, don't wanna be confused,
Don't wanna amuse nobody, I don't wanna be amused,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
Got to do unto others like you'd have them––said like you'd have them do unto you.

Don't wanna betray nobody, don't wanna be betrayed,
Don't wanna play with nobody, don't wanna be waylaid,
Don't wanna miss nobody, don't wanna be missed,
Don't put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist,
But, if you do right to me, baby, I'll do right to you too,
You got to do unto others like you'd have them––like you'd have them do unto you.
