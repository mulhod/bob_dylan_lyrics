Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls.
She takes just like a woman
And she aches just like a woman
And she makes love just like a woman,
But she breaks just like a little girl.

Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Till she sees finally that she's just like all the rest
In her fog with her amphetamine and her pearls.
She takes just like a woman
And she aches just like a woman
And she makes love just like a woman,
But she breaks just like a little girl.

It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here,
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
That I just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
When we meet again, introduced as friends,
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
Well, you fake just like a woman
And you take just like a woman,
You even make love just like a woman,
But you break just like a little girl.
