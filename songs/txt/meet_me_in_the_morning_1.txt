Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha,
Honey, we could be in Kansas by the time the snow begins to thaw.

They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn,
But a-you wouldn't know it by me, every day's been darkness since you been gone.

Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind,
Well, I feel just like that rooster, honey, you treat me so unkind.

Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above,
Well, you know, I've even outrun the hound dog, honey, you know I've earned your love.

Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Look at the sun sinking like a ship,
Ain't that just like my heart, babe, when you kiss my lips?
