Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
I believe I'm fixing to die.
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord,
I believe I'm fixing to die.
Well, I don't mind dying,
But I hate to leave my children crying.
Well, look over yonder to that burying ground!
Look over yonder to that burying ground!
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down.

Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord,
I believe I'm fixing to die.
Well, I don't mind dying,
But I hate to leave my children crying.
There's a black smoke rising, Lord,
It's rising up above my head, up above my head.
Well, there's black smoke rising, Lord,
It's rising up above my head,
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed.

Well, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die.
Yes, I'm walking kind of funny, Lord,
I believe I'm fixing to die,
Fixing to die, fixing to die.
Well, I don't mind dying,
But I hate to leave my children crying.
