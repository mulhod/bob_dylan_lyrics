One time in London I'd gone out for a walk
Past a place called Hyde Park where people talk
'Bout all kinds of different gods, they have their point of view,
To anyone passing by, that's who they're talking to.

There was someone on a platform talking to the folks
About the TV god and all the pain that it invokes.
“It's too bright a light,” he said, “for anybody's eyes,
If you've never seen one, it's a blessing in disguise.”

I moved in closer, got up on my toes,
Two men in front of me were coming to blows.
Man was saying something 'bout children when they're young
Being sacrificed to it while lullabies are being sung.

“The news of the day is on all the time,
All the latest gossip, all the latest rhyme.
Your mind is your temple, keep it beautiful and free,
Don't let an egg get laid in it by something you can't see.”

“Pray for peace!” he said, you could feel it in the crowd.
My thoughts began to wander, but his voice was ringing loud.
“It will destroy your family, your happy home is gone.
No one can protect you from it once you turn it on.”

“It will lead you into some strange pursuits,
Lead you to the land of forbidden fruits.
It'll scramble up your head, drag your brain about.
Sometimes you gotta do like Elvis did and shoot the damn thing out.”

“It's all been designed,” he said, “to make you lose your mind
And, when you go back to find it, there's nothing there to find.
Every time you look at it, your situation's worse.
If you feel it grabbing out for you, send for the nurse.”

The crowd begun to riot and they grabbed hold of the man,
There was pushing, there was shoving, and everybody ran,
TV crew was there to film it, they jumped right over me.
Later on that evening I watched it on TV.
