If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Say for me that I'm alright, though things get kind of slow,
She might think that I've forgotten her – don't tell her, it isn't so.

We had a falling-out like lovers often will
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.

If you get close to her, kiss her once for me,
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free.
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
For the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay.

I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.

Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
