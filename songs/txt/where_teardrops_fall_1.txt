Far away where the soft winds blow,
Far away from it all,
There is a place you go
Where teardrops fall.

Far away in the stormy night,
Far away and over the wall,
You are there in the flickering light
Where teardrops fall.

We banged the drum slowly
And played the fife lowly,
You know the song in my heart.
In the turning of twilight,
In the shadows of moonlight,
You can show me a new place to start.

I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup,
Stripping away at it all,
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Where teardrops fall.

By rivers of blindness,
In love and with kindness,
We can hold up a toast if we meet
To the cutting of fences
To sharpen the senses
That linger in the fireball heat.

Roses are red, violets are blue,
And time is beginning to crawl.
I just might have to come see you
Where teardrops fall.
