I ain't looking to make you cry,
See you fly or watch you die,
I don't care if you feel like me,
See like me or be like me.
All I really wanna do,
All I really wanna do,
All I really wanna do
Is, baby, be friends with you.

I don't want to meet your kin,
Make you spin or do you in,
And I don't want to drag you down,
Chain you down or be your clown.
All I really wanna do,
All I really wanna do,
All I really wanna do
Is, baby, be friends with you.

I don't care if you analyze me,
Categorize me or hypnotize me,
And I don't care if you feel like me,
See like me or be like me.
All I really wanna do,
All I really wanna do,
All I really wanna do
Is, baby, be friends with you,
Friends with you,
Friends with you.

<i>Alright, thank you.</i>
