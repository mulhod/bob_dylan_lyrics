I'm a-walking through the summer nights, the jukebox playing low,
Yesterday everything was going too fast, today it's moving too slow.
I got no place left to turn,
I got nothing left to burn.
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you,
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow.
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
I got nothing to go back to now.

The light in this place is so bad, making me sick in the head,
All the laughter is just making me sad, the stars have turned cherry-red.
I'm strumming on my gay guitar,
Smoking a cheap cigar.
The ghost of our old love has not gone away,
Don't look it––like it will anytime soon.
You left me standing in the doorway crying
Under the midnight moon.

Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't, but not tonight and it won't be here,
There are things I could say but I don't, I know the mercy of God must be near.
I been riding the midnight train,
Got ice water in my veins.
I would be crazy if I took you back,
It would go up against every rule.
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Suffering like a fool.

When the last rays of daylight go down, buddy, you'll roll no more,
I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard, I wonder who they're ringing for.
I know I can't win,
But my heart just won't give in.
Last night I danced with a stranger,
But she just reminded me you were the one.
You left me standing in the doorway crying
In the dark land of the sun.

I'll eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and live my life on the square,
And, even if the flesh falls off of my face, I know someone will be there to care.
It always means so much,
Even the softest touch.
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation,
There's no words that need to be said.
You left me standing in the doorway crying,
Blues wrapped around my head.
