On a night like this I'm so glad you came around,
Hold on to me so tight and heat up some coffee grounds.
We got much to talk about and much to reminisce,
It sure is right on a night like this.

On a night like this I'm so glad you're here to stay,
Hold on to me, pretty miss, and say you'll never go away to stray.
Run your fingers down my spine and bring me a touch of bliss,
It sure feels right on a night like this.

On a night like this I can't get any sleep,
The air is so cold outside and the snow's so deep.
Build a fire, throw on logs, and listen to it hiss,
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn on a night like this.

Put your body next to mine and keep me company,
There is plenty of room for all, so please don't elbow me.
Let the four winds blow around this old cabin door –
If I'm not too far off, I think we did this once before.
There's more frost on the window glass with each new, tender kiss,
But it sure feels right on a night like this.
