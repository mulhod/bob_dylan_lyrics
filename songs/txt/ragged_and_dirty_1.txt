Lord, I'm broke, I'm hungry, ragged and dirty too,
Broke and hungry, ragged and dirty too,
If I clean up, sweet mama, can I stay all night with you?

Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds,
Heard my best friend a-coming and I thought I heard my baby cry.

Lord, if I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door,
If I can't come in here, baby, then just let me sit down in your door
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.

Ah, how can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
How can I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
Well, that woman that I got, man, she does just what she feels.

Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild,
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.

'Cause I'm leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blinds,
Well, I been mistreated and I swear I don't mind dying.
