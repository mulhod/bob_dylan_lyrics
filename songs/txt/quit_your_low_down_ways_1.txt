Well, you can read out your Bible,
You can fall down on your knees
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
You're gonna need my help someday.
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Please quit your low-down ways.

You can run down to the desert,
You can stick your head in the sand,
You can raise up your right hand,
But your good man ain't a-coming home, you better understand,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday,
Someday gonna need my help, someday.
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Please quit your low-down ways.

Now, you can run down to the White House,
You can gaze on the Capitol Dome,
You can knock on the President's gate, pretty mama,
But, you know, it's gonna be too late,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, my help someday.
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Please quit your low-down ways.

And you can hitchhike on the highway,
You can stand all alone by the side of the road,
Try to flag a ride back home, pretty mama,
But you ain't a-gonna ride in my car no more,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, yes, you**1**.
Well, if you can't quit your sinning,
Please quit your low-down ways.

So you can read out your hymn-book,
You can fall down on your knees
And pray to the Lord, pretty mama,
But it ain't gonna do no good,
You're gonna need – you're gonna need my help someday, oh, wait and see.
If you can't quit your sinning,
Please quit your low-down ways.

**1** May be "you" ("ya") or a shortened, lax form of "yeah".
