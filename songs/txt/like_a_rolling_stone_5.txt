Once upon a time you dressed so fine,
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People'd call, say, “Beware, doll,
You're bound to fall.” You thought they're all kidding you.
You used to laugh–make fun about
Everybody that was hanging out.
Now you don't talk so loud,
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to scrounge your next meal.
And how does it feel?
A-how does it feel
To be out on your own,
So unknown,
Like a rolling stone?

<i>My voice is gone, man. You wanna try it again?</i>
