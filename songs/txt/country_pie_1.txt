Just like old Saxophone Joe when he's got the hogshead up on his toe –
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!

Listen to the fiddler play when he's playing till the break of day –
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!

Raspberry, strawberry, lemon, and lime – what do I care?
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin, and plum – call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there.

Saddle me up my big, white goose, tie me on her and turn her loose –
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!

I don't need much, that ain't no lie – ain't running any race!
Give to me my country pie, I won't throw it up in anybody's face!

Shake me up that old peach tree, little Jack Horner got nothing on me –
Oh me, oh my, love that country pie!
