Farewell, Angelina, the bells of the crown
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the sound.
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow,
But farewell, Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go.

There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame,
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same.
The table stands empty by the edge of the stream,
But farewell, Angelina, the sky's changing colors and I must leave.

The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard,
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild,
Farewell, Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while.

See the cross-eyed pirates sit perched in the sun,
Shooting tin cans with a sawed-off shotgun,
And the cockerels and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast,
But farewell, Angelina, the sky, it is trembling and I must leave fast.

King Kong, little elves in the rooftops, they dance
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands.
Shut the eyes of the dead not to embarrass anyone,
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must be gone.

The camouflage parrot, he flutters from fear
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears.
What cannot be imitated perfect must die,
Farewell, Angelina, the sky's flooding over and I must go where it is dry.

Machine guns are roaring, puppets heave rocks
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks.
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it,
But farewell, Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet.
