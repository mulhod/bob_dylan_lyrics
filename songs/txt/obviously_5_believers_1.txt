Early in the morning, early in the morning
I'm calling you to–I'm calling you to please come home.
Yes, I could make it without you if I just didn't feel so all alone.

Don't let me down, don't let me down.
I won't let you down, I won't let you down, no, I won't.
You know that I know, honey, but, honey, please don't.

I got my black dog barking, black dog barking.
Yes, he is, now–yes, he is outside my yard.
Yes, I'd tell you what it means if I just didn't have to try so hard.

Your mama's working, your mama's moaning.
She's crying, you know, she's trying, you know, you better go now.
Well, I'd tell you what she wants if I––but I just don't know how.

Fifteen jugglers, fifteen jugglers,
Five believers, five believers all dressed like men.
Tell your mama not to worry because, yes, they're just my friends.

Early in the morning, early in the morning
I'm calling you to–I'm calling you to please come home.
Yes, I could make it without you, honey, if I just did not feel so all alone.
