Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,
The birdies were flying from tree to tree,
There was little to say, there was no conversation
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree,
And the locusts sang off in the distance,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.

I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.
I was ready to leave, I was already walking,
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Oh, the locusts sang that high, whining trill,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.

Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading,
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees,
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding –
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn't fall on me!
Yeah, and the locusts sang off in the distance,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.

I put down my robe, I picked up my diploma,
Took a hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota –
Sure was glad to get out of there alive!
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody,
And the locusts sang with that high, whining trill,
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me,
Singing for me, well, singing for me.
