Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by,
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
And then I turn my head for you're approaching me.
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter looking in to my room
With the golden loom.

First, we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
And then the tears roll down – what a bitter taste!
You drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom
With your golden loom.

I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night,
I see the trembling lion with lotus flower tail
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
Then you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
And your golden loom.
