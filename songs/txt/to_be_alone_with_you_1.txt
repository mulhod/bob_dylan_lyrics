Is it rolling, Bob?

To be alone with you,
Just you and me.
Now, won't you tell me true,
Ain't that the way it oughtta be?
To hold each other tight
The whole night through.
Everything is always right
When I'm alone with you.

To be alone with you
At the close of the day,
With only you in view
While evening slips away.
It only goes to show
That, while life's pleasures be few,
The only one I know
Is when I'm alone with you.

They say the nighttime is the right time to be with the one you love.
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day, but you're always what I'm thinking of.
I wish tonight were here,
Bringing me all of your charms,
When only you are near
To hold me in your arms.
I'll always thank the Lord
When my working day's through.
I get my sweet reward,
To be alone with you.
