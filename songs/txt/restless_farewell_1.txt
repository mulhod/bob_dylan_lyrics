Oh, all the money that in my whole life I did spend,
Be it mine right or wrongfully,
I let it slip gladly to my friends
To tie up the time most forcefully.
But the bottles are done,
We've killed each one,
And the table's full and overflowed,
And the corner sign
Says it's closing time
So I'll bid farewell and be down the road.

Oh, every girl that ever I've touched,
I did not do it harmfully
And every girl that ever I've hurt,
I did not do it knowingly.
But, to remain as friends,
You need the time to make amends and stay behind
And, since my feet are now fast
And point away from the past,
I'll bid farewell and be down the line.

Oh, every foe that ever I faced,
The cause was there before we came
And every cause that ever I fought,
I fought it full without regret or shame.
But the dark does die
As the curtain is drawn and somebody's eyes
Must meet the dawn
And, if I see the day,
I'd only have to stay,
So I'll bid farewell in the night and be gone.

Oh, every thought that's strung a knot in my mind,
I might go insane if it couldn't be sprung,
But it's not to stand naked under unknowing eyes,
It's for myself and my friends my stories are sung.
But the time ain't tall,
Yet on time you depend, and no word is possessed
By no special friend
And, though the line is cut,
It ain't quite the end.
I'll just bid farewell till we meet again.

Oh, a false clock tries to tick out my time,
To disgrace, distract, and bother me,
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
And the dust of rumors covers me.
But, if the arrow is straight
And the point is slick,
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
So I'll make my stand
And remain as I am
And bid farewell and not give a damn.
