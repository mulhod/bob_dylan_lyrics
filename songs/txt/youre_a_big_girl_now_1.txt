Our conversation was short and sweet,
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
And I'm back in the rain,
Oh, and you are on dry land,
You made it there somehow,
You're a big girl now.

Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
And I'm just like that bird,
Oh, singing just for you,
I hope that you can hear––
Hear me singing through these tears.

Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
I can change, I swear,
Oh, see what you can do,
I can make it through,
You can make it too.

Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Oh, in somebody's room,
It's a price I have to pay,
You're a big girl all the way.

A change in the weather is known to be extreme,
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
I'm going out of my mind,
Oh, with a pain that stops and starts,
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Ever since we've been apart.
