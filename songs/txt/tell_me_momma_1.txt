Cold, black glass don't make no mirror,
Cold, black water don't make no tears.
You say you love me with what be––may be love,
Don't you remember making baby love?
Yes, you got your steam drill, now you're looking for some kid
To get it to work for you like your nine-pound hammer did,
But I know that you know that I know that you show something
Is tearing up your mind.
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
What's wrong with you this time?

Black sunglass can't make pony run,
Tombstone bay dog**1** can't get it done,
Fool's gold in your teeth and cemetery hips,
Baby, outside of your graveyard lips.
Yes, everybody's wondering when your friendship's gonna end,
But come on, baby, I'm your friend!
And I know that you know that I know that you show something
Is tearing up your mind.
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
What's wrong with you this time?

Oh, [incomprehensible] but your ace is red –
The man**2**, he can't get it, he's almost dead.
Everybody sees you on your window ledge.
How long's it gonna take for you to get off the edge?
You're just gonna make everybody jump and roar.
Now, what you wanna go and do that for?
I know that you know that I know that you show something
Is tearing up your mind.
Tell me, mama, tell me, mama, tell me, mama, what is it?
What's wrong with you this time?

**1** It's unclear what Dylan says in this line, particularly the phrase I've transcribed as “bay dog.” Support for this interpretation might be that in other transcriptions of this song, the phrase “water dog” appears (though in the first verse instead of the second).
**2** This is just a suggestion. Dylan could be saying something like, “And, then,…” or perhaps Dylan is saying a name that I cannot identify.
