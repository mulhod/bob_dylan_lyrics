Mama, take this badge off of me,
I can't use it anymore,
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.

Mama, put my guns in the ground,
I can't fire them anymore,
That long, black train is pulling down,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.

Ma, wipe the blood from my face,
I can't see through it anymore,
It's a feeling that I just can't trace,
Feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.

<i>Alright, thank you very much.</i>**1**

**1** Actually occurs during the beginning of the next track on the album, "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)".
