Trouble in the city, trouble in the farm,
You got your rabbit's foot, you got your good-luck charm,
But they can't help you none when there's trouble,
Trouble,
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.

Trouble in the water, trouble in the air,
Go all the way to the other side of the world, you'll find trouble there,
Revolution <i>[incoherent]</i>**1** no solution for trouble,
Trouble,
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.

Drought and starvation, packaging of the soul,
Persecution, execution, governments outta control,
You can see the writing on the wall inviting the trouble,
Trouble,
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.

Put your ear to the train tracks, put your ear to the ground,
You ever feel like you're never alone even when there's nobody else around?
Since the beginning of the universe, man's been cursed by trouble,
Trouble,
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.

Nightclubs of the broken-hearted, stadiums of the damned,
Legislature, perverted nature, doors that are rudely slammed,
Look into infinity, all you see is trouble,
Trouble,
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.

Trouble,
Trouble,
Trouble, trouble, trouble, nothing but trouble.

Trouble…

**1** Here, "[incoherent]" represents word(s) that I could not transcribe. According to other lyrics sources, the line is: "Revolution even ain't no solution for trouble", which I think is a stretch.
