I wandered again to my home in the mountain
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free,
I looked for my friends, but I never could find them,
I found they were all rank strangers to me.

Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
I found they were all rank strangers to me.

“They've all moved a way,” said the voice of a stranger,
“To that beautiful shore by the bright, crystal sea.”
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Where no one will be a stranger to me.

Everybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger,
No mother or dad, not a friend could I see,
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces,
I found they were all rank strangers to me.
