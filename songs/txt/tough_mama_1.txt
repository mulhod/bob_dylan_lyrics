Tough mama, meat shaking on your bone,
I'm gonna go down to the river and get some stone.
Sister's on the highway with that steel-driving crew,
Papa's in the big house, his working days are through,
Tough mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?

Dark beauty, won't you move over and give me some room?
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies,
Dark beauty, with that long night's journey in your eyes.

Sweet goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you been.
Jack the Cowboy went up north, he's buried in the past,
Lone Wolf went out drinking – that was over pretty fast,
Sweet goddess, your perfect stranger's coming on in at last.

Silver angel, with the badge of the lonesome road written in your sleeve,
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you'd receive.
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch –
Sweet goddess, must be time to carve another notch.

I'm crestfallen, a world of illusions**1** at my door,
I ain't hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
Prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight,
I've gained some recognition, but I lost my appetite –
Sweet beauty, meet me at the border late tonight.

**1** Note that it's impossible to tell whether the line is "...a world of illusion's at my door..." or "...a world of illusions at my door...".
