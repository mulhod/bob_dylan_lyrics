If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier,
She left here last early spring, is living there, I hear,
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go,
She might think that I've forgotten her – don't tell her, it isn't so.

We had a falling-out like lovers often will,
But to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill,
And, though our separation, it pierced me to the heart,
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.

If you're making love to her, kiss for the kid
Who always has respected her for doing what she did.
Oh, I know it had to be that way, it was written in the cards,
But the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard.

I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
And I hear her name a-here and there as I go from town to town
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off,
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft.

Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past,
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast.
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find,
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.
