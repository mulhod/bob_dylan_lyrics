I didn't mean to treat you so bad.
You shouldn't take it so personal.
I didn't mean to make you so sad.
You just happened to be there, that's all.
When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile,
I thought that it was well-understood
That you'd be coming back in a little while.
I didn't know that you were saying goodbye for good.
But sooner or later one of us must know
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
Sooner or later one of us must know
That I really did try to get close to you.

I couldn't see what you could show me.
Your scarf, it kept your mouth well-hid.
I couldn't see how you could know me,
But you said you knew me and I believed you did.
When you whispered in my ear
And asked me if I was leaving with you or her,
I didn't realize just what I did hear,
I didn't realize how young you were.
But sooner or later one of us must know
That you're just doing what you're supposed to do.
Sooner or later one of us must know
That I really did try to get close to you.

I couldn't see when it started snowing.
Your voice was all that I heard.
I couldn't see where we were going,
But you said you knew and I took your word.
And then you told me later as I apologized
That you were just kidding me, you weren't really from the farm.
And I told you as you clawed out my eyes
That I never really meant to do you any harm.
But sooner or later one of us must know
That you just did what you're supposed to do.
Sooner or later one of us must know
That I really did try to get close to you.
