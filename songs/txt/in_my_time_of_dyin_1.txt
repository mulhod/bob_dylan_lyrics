Well, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to mourn.
All I want for you to do is take my body home,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Well, well, well,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.

Well, meet me, Jesus, meet me,
Meet me in the middle of the air.
If these wings should fail me, Lord,
Won't you meet me with another pair?
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Well, well, well,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.

Lord, in my time of dying, don't want nobody to cry.
All I want you to do is take me when I die,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Well, well, well,
Well, well, well, so I can die easy,
Jesus gonna make up–Jesus gonna make up–
Jesus gonna make up my dying bed.
