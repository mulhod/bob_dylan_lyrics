God knows you ain't pretty,
God knows it's true,
God knows there ain't anybody ever gonna take the place of you.

God knows it's a struggle,
God knows it's a crime,
God knows there's gonna be no more water but fire next time.

God don't call it treason,
God don't call it wrong,
It was supposed to last a season, but it's been so strong for so long.

God knows it's fragile,
God knows everything,
God knows it could snap apart right now, just like putting scissors to a string.

God knows it's terrifying,
God sees it all unfold,
There's a million reasons for you to be crying, you been so bold and so cold.

God knows that, when you see it,
God knows you've got to weep,
God knows the secrets of your heart, He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.

God knows there's a river,
God knows how to make it flow,
God knows you ain't gonna be taking nothing with you when you go.

God knows there's a purpose,
God knows there's a chance,
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour of any circumstance.

God knows there's a heaven,
God knows it's outta sight,
God knows we can get all the way from here to there if we've gotta walk a million miles by candlelight.

God knows...**1**

**1** There are more lines here at the end, but the song fades out and it's nearly impossible to make out what they are.
