No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.

No more driver's lash for me, no more, no more,
No more driver's lash for me, many thousand gone.

No more whip-lash for me, no more, no more,
No more pint of salt for me, many thousand gone.

No more auction block for me, no more, no more,
No more auction block for me, many thousand gone.
