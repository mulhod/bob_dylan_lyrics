<i>This is a somewhat new song called “Seven Days”.</i>

Seven days,
Seven more days she'll be coming,
I'll be waiting at the station
For her to arrive,
Seven more days all I gotta do is survive.

She been gone
Ever since I been a child,
Ever since I seen her smile.
I've never forgotten her eyes,
She had a face that outshined the sun in the skies.

I been good,
I been good while I been waiting,
But maybe guilty of a-hesitating.
But I've been hanging on,
Seven more days and all that will be gone.

Well, there's kissing in the valley,
Thieving in the alley,
Fighting every inch of the way.
Trying to get a lead on
Somebody I need to feed off**1**
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.

Seven days,
Seven days zipping**2** and blowing,
But then a whistle will be blowing
And she'll be coming forth,
My beautiful comrade from the north.

Well, there's a-fighting in the valley,
Thieving in the alley,
Fighting every inch of the way.
Trying to get a lead on
Somebody I need to feed off
Where the nights are always sadder than the day.

Seven days
And I'll know the wind blows snowing**3**
And then a whistle will be blowing,
She'll be coming forth,
My beautiful comrade from the north.

<i>Thank you.</i>
