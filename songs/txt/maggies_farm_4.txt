I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
Said I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain,
Got a head full of ideas driving me insane.
It's a shame the way she make me scrub the floor.
Ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more,
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.
He fine you a nickel, he fine you a dime,
Ask you with a grin, “You having a good time?”
Then he fine you every time you slam the door.
Ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more.

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more,
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.
Well, he puts his cigar out your face just for kicks,**1**
His bedroom window is made outta bricks.
Well, the National Guard stands around his door.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's pa no more.

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more,
Said I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.
Well, she talks to all the servants about man and God and law,
Everybody tells me she's the brains behind pa.
68, but says she's 24.
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more.

I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
Well, I try my best to be just like I am,
Everybody wants you to be just like them,
They say “Sing!” while you slave -- I get bored.
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more.
