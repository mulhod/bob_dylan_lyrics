We live in a political world,
Love don't have any place,
We living in times when men commit crimes
And crime don't have a face.

We live in a political world,
Icicles hanging down,
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
And clouds cover up the ground.

We live in a political world,
Wisdom is thrown into jail,
It rots in a cell misguided as hell,
Leaving no one to pick up the trail.

We live in a political world
Where mercy walks the plank,
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
Up the steps into the nearest bank.

We live in a political world,
Courage is a thing of the past,
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted,
The next day could be your last.

We live in a political world,
The one we can see and can feel,
But there's no one to check, it's all a stacked deck,
We all know for sure that it's real.

We live in a political world,
The cities of a lonesome fear,
Little by little you turn in the middle,
But you're never sure why you're here.

We live in a political world,
Under the microscope,
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there,
You always got more than enough rope.

We live in a political world,
Turning and a-thrashing about,
As soon as you're awake, you're trained to take
What looks like the easy way out.

We live in a political world
Where peace is not welcome at all,
It's turned away from the door to wander some more
Or put up against the wall.

We live in a political world,
Everything's a-hers or his,
Climb into the frame and shout God's name,
But you're not even sure what it is.
