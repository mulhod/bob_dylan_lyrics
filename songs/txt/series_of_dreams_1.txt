I was thinking of a series of dreams
Where nothing comes up to the top,
Everything stays down where it's wounded
And comes to a permanent stop,
Wasn't thinking of anything specific
Like in a dream when someone wakes up and screams,
Nothing too very scientific,
Just thinking of a series of dreams.

Thinking of a series of dreams
Where the time and the tempo drag
And there's no exit in any direction
'Cept the one that you can't see with your eyes,
Wasn't making any great connection,
Wasn't falling for any intricate scheme,
Nothing that would pass inspection,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
And into the path you are hurled
And the cards are no good that you're holding
Unless they're from another world.

In one the surface was frozen,
In another I witnessed a crime,
In one I was running and in another
All I seemed to be doing was climb,
Wasn't looking for any special assistance
And not going through any great extreme,
I'd already gone the distance,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Dreams where the umbrella is folded
And into the path you are hurled
And the cards are no good that you're holding
Unless they're from another world.
I'd already gone the distance,
I's just thinking of a series of dreams,
Just thinking of a series of dreams,
Just thinking of a series of dreams.
