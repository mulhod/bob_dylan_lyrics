I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,
I love you more than money and more than the stars above,
Love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea,
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.

Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,
I say goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,
To the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun –
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.

You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live,
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give,
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole –
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul.

You gave me babies, one, two, three – what is more? you saved my life,
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife,
My thoughts of you don't ever rest – they'd kill me if I lie,
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die.

The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth,
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth.
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood,
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood.

It's never been my duty to remake the world at large,
Nor is it my intentions to sound a battle charge
'Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn't bend
And, if there is eternity, I'll love you there again.

Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride?
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece,
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease.

You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see,
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on,
'Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone.
