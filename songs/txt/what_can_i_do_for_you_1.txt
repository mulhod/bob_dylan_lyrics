You have given everything to me,
What can I do for You?
You have given me eyes to see,
What can I do for You?

Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside,
Filled up the hunger that had always been denied,
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide,
And You chosen me to be among the few,
What can I do for You?

You have laid down Your life for me,
What can I do for You?
You have explained every mystery,
What can I do for You?

Soon as a man is born, you know, the sparks begin to fly,
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie.
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die?
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do,
What can I do for You?

You have given all there is to give,
What can I give to You?
You have given me life to live,
How can I live for You?

I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts,
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts,
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart –
Well, I don't deserve it, but I sure did make it through,
What can I do for You?
