Well, my nerves are exploding and my body's tense,
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence.
I've been hit too hard, I seen too much,
Nothing can heal me now but your touch.
I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
I was alright till I fell in love with you.

Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky,.
Well, I thought it would rain, but the clouds passed by.
Now, I feel like I'm coming to the end of my way,
But I know God is my shield and he won't lead me astray.
Still I don't know what I'm gonna do,
I was alright till I fell in love with you.

Boys in the street beginning to play,
Girls like birds fly away.
When I'm gone, you will remember my name,
I'm gonna win my way to wealth and to fame.
Yet I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
I was alright till I fell in love with you.

Well, junk's piling up, taking up space,
My eyes feel like they're falling off my face.
Sweat pouring down, I'm staring at the floor,
I'm thinking about that girl who won't be back no more.
I just don't know what to do,
I was alright till I fell in love with you.

Well, I'm tired of talking, I'm tired of trying to explain,
My attempts to please you, they were all in vain.
Tomorrow night, before the sun goes down,
If I'm still among the living, I'll be Dixie-bound.
Still I just don't know what I'm gonna do,
I was alright till I fell in love with you.
