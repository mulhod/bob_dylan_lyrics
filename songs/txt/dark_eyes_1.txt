Oh, the gentlemen are talking
And the midnight moon is on the riverside,
They're drinking up and walking
And it is time for me to slide.
I live in another world
Where life and death are memorized,
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls
And all I see are dark eyes.

A cock is crowing far away
And another soldier's deep in prayer,
Some mother's child has gone astray,
She can't find him anywhere.
But I can hear another drum
Beating for the dead that rise,
Whom nature's beast fears as they come,
And all I see are dark eyes.

They tell me to be discreet
For all intended purposes,
They tell me revenge is sweet
And, from where they stand, I'm sure it is,
But I feel nothing for their game
Where beauty goes unrecognized,
All I feel is heat and flame
And all I see are dark eyes.

Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise
And a drunken man is at the wheel,
Hunger pays a heavy price
To the falling gods of speed and steel.
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet
And passion rules the arrow that flies.
A million faces at my feet,
But all I see are dark eyes.
