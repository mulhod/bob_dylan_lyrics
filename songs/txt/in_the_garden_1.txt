When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
Did they know He was the son of God, did they know that He was Lord?
Did they hear when He told Peter, “Peter, put up your sword”?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?
When they came for Him in the garden, did they know?

When they heard him speak in the city, did they hear?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
Nicodemus came at night, so he wouldn't be seen by men,
Saying, “Master, tell me why a man must be born again.”
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?
When He spoke to them in the city, did they hear?

When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
When He said, “Pick up your bed and walk!”, why must you criticize?
“Same thing my father do I can do likewise.”**1**
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?
When He healed the blind and crippled, did they see?

Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
The multitude wanted to make Him king, put a crown upon His head,
Why did He slip away to a quiet place instead?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?
Did they speak out against Him, did they dare?

When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?
He said-a, “All power is given to Me in heaven and on earth” –
Did they know right then and there what that power was worth?
When He rose up from the dead, did they believe?
When He rose from the dead, did they believe?

**1** According to other lyrics sources, this line and the previous one form one whole quotation from Jesus: "When He said, 'Pick up your bed and walk, why must you criticize? Same thing my father do I can do likewise.'"
