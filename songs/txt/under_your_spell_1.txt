Something about you that I can't shake,
Don't know how much more of this I can take.
Baby, I'm under your spell.

I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night,
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light.
Baby, oh, what a story I could tell!

It's been nice seeing you, you read me like a book.
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look,
Baby, I'll be at the same hotel.

I'd like to help you, but I'm in a bit of a jam,
I'll call you tomorrow if there's phones where I am,
Baby, caught between heaven and hell.

But I will be back, I will survive,
You'll never get rid of me as long as you're alive,
Baby, can't you tell?

Well, it's four in the morning by the sound of the birds,
I'm staring at your picture, I'm hearing your words,
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell.

Everywhere you go, it's enough to break hearts,
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts.
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow,
I trusted you, baby, you can trust me now.

Turn back, baby, wipe your eye,
Don't think I'm leaving you here without a kiss goodbye.
Baby, is there anything left to tell?

I'll see you later when I'm not so out of my head,
Maybe next time I'll let the dead bury the dead.
Baby, what more can I tell?

Well, the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed,
Pray that I don't die of thirst,
Baby, two feet from the well.
