Mama, take this badge off of me,
I can't use it anymore.
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.

Mama, put my guns in the ground,
I can't shoot them anymore.
That long, black cloud is coming down,
I feel I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
