If not for you,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Couldn't even see the floor,
I'd be sad and blue,
If not for you.

If not for you,
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,
Wait for the morning light
To shine in through,
But it would not be new,
If not for you.

If not for you, my sky would fall,
Rain would gather, too.
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
I'd be lost if not for you and you know it's true.

If not for you, my sky would fall,
Rain would gather, too.
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,
Oh, what would I do if not for you?

If not for you,
Winter would have no spring,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
Anyway, it wouldn't ring true,
If not for you,
If not for you,
If not for you,
If not for you,
If not for you.
