I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
I woke in the morning, wandering, weary and worn out,
Wishing my long-lost lover would walk to me, talk to me, tell me what it's all about.

I was standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock,
Standing at the side road, listening to the billboard knock.
Well, my wrist was empty, but my nerves were kicking, ticking like a clock.

If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front,
If I got anything you need, babe, let me tell you in front:
You can come to me sometime, nighttime, daytime, any time you want.

Sometimes I'm thinking I'm too high to fall,
Sometimes I'm thinking I'm much too high to fall.
Other times I'm thinking I'm so low I don't know if I can come up at all.

Black crows in the meadow, sleeping across a broad highway,
Black crows in the meadow, across a broad highway.
Though it's funny, honey: I'm outta touch, don't feel much like a scarecrow today.
