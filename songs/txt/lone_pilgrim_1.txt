I came to the place where the lone pilgrim lay
And pensively stood by his tomb
When in a low whisper I heard something say,
“How sweetly I sleep here alone.”

“The tempest may howl and the loud thunder roar
And gathering storms may arise,
But calm is my feeling, at rest is my soul,
The tears are all wiped from my eyes.”

“The calls of my master compelled me from home,
No kindred or relative nigh.
I met the contagion and sank to the tomb,
My soul flew to mansions on high.”

“Go tell my companion and children most dear
To weep not for me now I'm gone.
The same hand that led me through seas most severe
Has kindly assisted me home.”
