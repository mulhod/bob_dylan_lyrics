Well, the rain-man comes with his magic wand,
But the judge says, “Mona can't have no bond.”
The walls collide, Mona cries.
Rain-man leaves in the wolf-man's disguise. Oh!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!

Now the undertaker in his midnight suit
Says to the madman, “Ain't you cute!”
The madman, he jumps up on the shelf,
He says, “You ain't so bad yourself!” Oh, yeah!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!

Well, Jumping Judy can't go no higher,
She had bullets in her eyes and they fire.
Rasputin, he's so dignified,
Touched the back of her head and he died. Oh!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
Alright!

Well, Phaedra with her looking glass,
When she lays upon the grass,
She gets all messed up, she faints,
That's 'cause she's so obvious and you ain't. Oh, oh, well!
I wanna be your lover, baby, I wanna be your man,
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be hers, I wanna be yours!
I wanna be yours!
Alright, now!**1**
I'll hold it down for you.**2**
