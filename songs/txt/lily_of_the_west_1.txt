When first I came to Louisville some pleasure there to find,
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind,
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips like arrows pierced my breast.
The name she bore was Flora, the Lily of the West.

I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find,
But she turned unto another man, which so distressed my mind,
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest.
Then, go, my lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.

Way down in yonder shady grove a man of high degree
Conversing with my Flora there – it seemed so strange to me –
And the answer that she gave to him, it so did me oppress.
I was betrayed by Flora, the Lily of the West.

I stepped up to my rival, dagger in my hand,
And seized him by the collar, boldly made him stand.
Driven**1** mad by desperation, I pierced him to the breast –
All this for lovely Flora, the Lily of the West.

I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea,
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me.
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest,
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the West.

**1** According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_of_the_West">Wikipedia's version of the original Irish folk song<a>, this line begins, "Being driven to desperation..." In Dylan's version, it is difficult to hear exactly what the first word in the line is, but it sounds as though it could be "driven", which would follow fairly closely the folk ballad's original lyrics.
