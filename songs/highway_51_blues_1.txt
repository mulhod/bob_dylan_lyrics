Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
If I don't get the girl I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.

Well, I know that highway like I know my hand.
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand.
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land.

Well, if I should die 'fore my time should come,
And if I should die 'fore my time should come,
Won't you bury my body out on Highway 51?

Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
I said Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door.
If I don't get the gal I'm loving, won't go down Highway 51 no more.
